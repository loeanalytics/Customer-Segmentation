Overview

This project segments on customers sales dataset using K-Means Clustering and Gower Distance to handle mixed data types.

Dataset

Includes demographics, purchase behavior, and preferences.

Preprocessing

Checked  missing values

Encoded categorical variables

Scaled numerical data

Clustering Methods

K-Means Clustering: Used Elbow Method to determine clusters

Gower Distance + Agglomerative Clustering: Better suited for mixed data

### **Key Insights:**  
- **Customer Segments:** Identified groups based on age, gender, shopping behavior, and spending patterns.  
- **Gender Trends:** Differences in item preferences between male and female customers.  
- **Spending Behavior:** Clusters show budget-conscious vs. premium buyers.  
- **Frequency vs. Purchase Amount:** Frequent small purchases vs. infrequent large purchases.    

These insights help with **personalized marketing, inventory management, and targeted promotions**. 


Tools Used
